The name of the project is To Do Plan.
To Do Plan is a web application designed to facilitate the creation of plans with schedules, time of schedule, meeting, and place of meeting formatting. This platform aims to provide users with a simple and intuitive interface for composing and structuring plans online.

## About the App

Users can create new plans by providing a time, place, etc. This allows for flexible formatting options such as headings, lists, links, and more. Once a plan is created, users have the ability to edit and update its content as needed. This enables authors to refine their plans over time or make corrections as necessary. To Do Plan offers a preview function that allows users to preview their plan in real-time before publishing. This helps authors ensure that their content appears as intended with proper formatting. After creating and editing their plans, users can delete them.
